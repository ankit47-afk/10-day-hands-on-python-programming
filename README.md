10 Days Hands-on Python Programming – Workshop
This repository contains all the projects I completed during the 10-day Hands-on Python Programming Workshop at my college.
Each day we learned something new and created a small project based on that topic.
This helped me understand Python in a more practical way.

# Day-wise Projects
Day 1: Basic Calculator
Day 2: Calculator + Unit Converter
Day 3: Expiry Date Tracker (Food & Medicine)
Day 4: Voice Assistant (JARVIS)
Day 5: Tic Tac Toe Game

# My Experience
These 10 days helped me connect Python theory with real applications.
Building one project every day improved my problem-solving, logic, and confidence.
This workshop encouraged me to explore automation, APIs, and small AI features on my own.
