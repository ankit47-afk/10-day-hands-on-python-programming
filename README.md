10 Days Hands-on Python Programming – Workshop

This repository contains all the projects I worked on during the 10-day Hands-on Python Programming Workshop at my college.
Each day we learned a new concept and built a small project based on that topic.
These daily tasks helped me understand Python in a practical and easy way.

 # Day-wise Projects

Day 1: Basic Calculator

Day 2: Calculator + Unit Converter

Day 3: Expiry Date Tracker (Food & Medicine)

Day 4: Voice Assistant (JARVIS)

Day 5: Tic Tac Toe Game

# My Experience

These 10 days really helped me connect Python theory with real applications.
Creating one project every day improved my logic, problem-solving, and overall confidence in coding.
This workshop also motivated me to explore automation, APIs, and small AI features on my own.
